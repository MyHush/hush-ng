#  Hush Next-Generation

The Next Generation Hush GUI will include an integrated experience for users to
do tasks related to their wallets and having conversations with Hush Contacts,
i.e. sending + receiving HushList memos.

This wallet supports Shielded Addresses and Shielded Transactions.

Currently we are focused on HushList-related operations, since other basic wallets
exist. This codebase uses the Electron framework to enable cross-platform support
and supports Linux, Mac and Windows.
